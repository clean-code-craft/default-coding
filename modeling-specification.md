<table>
<tr><td>Essential</td><td>Implementation-free</td><td>Unambiguous*</td>

<tr><td>Consistent</td><td>Complete</td><td>Singular*</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Feasible</td><td>Traceable</td><td>Verifiable*</td>
</tr>
</table>

> Make it Verifiable. Then pursue completion.

`Exercise: Critique this- "The device shall sync to the backend when online.

`Exercise: Critique this-
